FatSOAP - PHP SOAP Implementation

These classes are the result of working with a very strict web service
that had a broken WSDL file describing it. I couldn't get any love from
it using PHP5's built in SOAP classes nor from the NuSOAP classes. Each
time I would think I was getting somewhere the end point would not
return any valid results and each time I would get feedback from the
vendor of the end point they would say it was the syntax of the request.

Using XMLObject as a base and manually declaring objects to be used in
the SOAP requests adds a little more overhead but gives you complete
control over how they are generated.

Initially this was written using the simplexml extension, but it too
proved to be inflexible in how the DOM was being generated. So now it
uses XMLWriter.

Here's a quick example (from example.php):

<?php
require 'fatsoap.php';

class Credentials extends XMLObject {
	public $Username;
	public $Password;

	public function __construct($user, $pass) {
		$this->Username = $user;
		$this->Password = $pass;
	}
}

class RequestQuote extends XMLObject {
	public $symbol;

	public $namespace = 'val';
	public $own_namespace = 'quote';
}

$c = new SOAP_Client('http://somefinancialsite.com/quotes/', array(
	'soapenv' => 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/',
	'val' => 'http://somefinancialsite.com/schema/val/',
	'quote' => 'http://somefinancialsite.com/schema/quote/',
));

$creds = new Credentials("thisismyusername", "superrrrrrsecret");

$req = new RequestQuote();
$req->symbol = "AAPL";

header('Content-Type: text/xml');
echo $c->show('RequestQuote', $req, $creds);

This produces:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:val="http://somefinancialsite.com/schema/val/" xmlns:quote="http://somefinancialsite.com/schema/quote/">
 <soapenv:Header>
  <Credentials>
   <Username>thisismyusername</Username>
   <Password>superrrrrrsecret</Password>
  </Credentials>
 </soapenv:Header>
 <soapenv:Body>

  <quote:RequestQuote>
   <val:symbol>AAPL</val:symbol>
  </quote:RequestQuote>
 </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
